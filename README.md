# Google Books Search

## Description

A web application that uses the Google Books API to view books and save them to a database. Once saved, users can view or delete the books. Each book displays an image, if they have one, the title, a list of authors, a description of the book, and a `View` button that opens up another tab of the book on Google Books. The application was developed using Mongoose, Express, Material-UI, and React.
